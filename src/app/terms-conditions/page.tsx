        <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply
          to you – you should make sure you read them carefully before using the
          app. You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the
          app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
          extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to
          translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions.
          The app itself, and all trademarks, copyright, database rights, and
          other intellectual property rights related to it, remain the property
          of <strong>Indie Goodies LLC</strong>.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Indie Goodies LLC is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful
          and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to
          make changes to the app or to charge for its services at any time and
          for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services
          without making it very clear to you exactly what you are paying for.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          The <strong>Antiquary</strong> app stores and processes personal data
          that you have provided to us in order to provide our service. It’s
          your responsibility to keep your device and access to the app secure.
          We recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is
          the process of removing software restrictions imposed by the official
          operating system. Doing so could make your device vulnerable to
          malware, viruses, malicious programs, and may compromise your device’s
          security features. It could also mean that the Antiquary app won’t work
          properly or at all.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          By signing up for an auto-renewing subscription through our app, you
          agree to the terms set out in Schedule 2, section 3.8(b) of the Paid
          Applications agreement. These terms include: clearly disclosing the
          subscription terms, obtaining your explicit consent before charging,
          providing an easy cancellation mechanism, and ensuring that you are
          not charged for a subscription you have canceled. By using our app and
          subscribing to our services, you acknowledge and agree to these terms.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          The app does use third-party services that declare their own Terms and
          Conditions:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 text-gray-700">
          <li>
            <a
              href="https://www.revenuecat.com/terms"

          </li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Certain functions of the app will require an active internet
          connection. The connection may be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile
          network provider, but Indie Goodies LLC cannot take responsibility if
          the app does not function fully due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if
          you have exhausted your data allowance.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, your mobile
          network provider’s agreement terms will still apply. This means you
          may be charged by your provider for data usage while accessing the
          app, including roaming data charges if used outside your home region
          or country. If you are not the bill payer for the device, we assume
          you have obtained permission from the bill payer.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Similarly, Indie Goodies LLC cannot take responsibility if your device
          is not charged and you cannot use the app. Ensuring that your device
          remains operational is your responsibility.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          While we endeavor to keep the app updated and accurate, we rely on
          third-party information. Indie Goodies LLC accepts no liability for
          any direct or indirect loss resulting from reliance on information
          within the app.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
          available on iOS – system requirements (and any additional platforms
          we extend to) may change. You’ll need to download updates to continue
          using the app. Indie Goodies LLC does not guarantee that the app will
          always remain compatible with your iOS version. We may also discontinue
          the app at any time without notice. Unless otherwise stated, upon
          termination: (a) your rights and licenses under these terms will end;
          (b) you must stop using the app and delete it from your device.
